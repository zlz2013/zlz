My father was a self-taught mandolin player.
He was one of the best string instrument players in our town.
 He could not read music, but if he heard a tune a few times,
 he could play it. When he was younger,
  he was a member of a small country music band.
He told the family that after he was hired he never went back.
Dad was a very religious man.
